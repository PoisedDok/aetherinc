# Docker Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. Created a working PostgreSQL Docker container setup:
   - PostgreSQL 16 database running in Docker
   - Port 5432 exposed to the host machine
   - Data persistence via Docker volume
   - Health check configured

2. Created a database setup script:
   - `scripts/db-setup.sh` for initializing the database
   - Handles waiting for PostgreSQL to be ready
   - Runs Prisma migrations
   - Seeds initial data

3. Documentation:
   - Created detailed guide in DOCKER_POSTGRES_GUIDE.md
   - Included troubleshooting steps
   - Added production considerations

## Current Setup

The current Docker setup focuses on providing a PostgreSQL database for the application. This approach allows you to:

1. Run the PostgreSQL database in a container
2. Run the Next.js application locally for development
3. Connect the local application to the containerized database

## Web Application Considerations

We encountered challenges building the Next.js application in a Docker container due to CSS processing issues. Some options for resolving these in the future:

1. Create a custom Next.js build process that bypasses problematic CSS optimizations
2. Use a multi-stage build with development dependencies installed only during build time
3. Pre-build the application locally and only containerize the output
4. Use a Node.js base image with additional build tools

## Next Steps

To complete a full containerization of both the database and web application:

1. Resolve the CSS build issues in the Next.js application
2. Optimize the Docker build process for the web application
3. Update the docker-compose.yml to include both services
4. Implement proper secrets management for production

## Using the Current Setup

To use the current PostgreSQL Docker setup:

1. Start the PostgreSQL container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Set up your database:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-setup.sh
   ```

3. Run your application locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
