# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Metadata colorScheme Warnings
- **Issue**: Multiple warnings about "Unsupported metadata colorScheme is configured in metadata export"
- **Fix**: Moved the `colorScheme` property from `metadata` to `viewport` in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Explanation**: Next.js 14+ requires the colorScheme property to be in the viewport export instead of metadata

### 2. Dynamic Server Usage Error
- **Issue**: Route `/api/admin/analytics/export` couldn't be rendered statically because it used `headers`
- **Fix**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to the route file
- **Explanation**: This explicitly marks the route as dynamic, resolving the build error

### 3. Sharp Missing in Production
- **Issue**: Error about 'sharp' being required in standalone mode for image optimization
- **Fix**: Installed the sharp package using `npm install sharp --save`
- **Explanation**: Next.js requires sharp for image optimization in standalone mode

### 4. Output Standalone Warning
- **Issue**: Warning that "next start" doesn't work with "output: standalone" configuration
- **Fix**: Created a custom start script (`scripts/start-production.mjs`) that properly handles standalone output
- **Explanation**: Added a new `start:prod` script in package.json that uses this custom script

## How to Use

### Development Mode
- Continue using `npm run dev` for development

### Production Mode
- Build with `npm run build`
- Start with `npm run start:prod` instead of `npm start`
- This will automatically detect if the app is in standalone mode and start it correctly

## Technical Details

1. The `colorScheme` property was moved to align with Next.js 14+ requirements
2. API routes that use headers or other dynamic features need to be explicitly marked as dynamic
3. Sharp is now included as a dependency for production image optimization
4. The custom start script handles the standalone output configuration by:
   - Checking if standalone output exists
   - Copying public assets if needed
   - Starting the server correctly based on the output format
