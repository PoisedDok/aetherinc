# Setup Summary

## Database Configuration
1. Installed PostgreSQL 14 via Homebrew: `brew install postgresql@14`
2. Started PostgreSQL service: `brew services start postgresql@14`
3. Created database user: `aetherinc_user` with password: `Kd14@Postgres`
4. Created database: `aetherinc` owned by `aetherinc_user`
5. Configured connection string: `postgresql://aetherinc_user:Kd14@Postgres@localhost:5432/aetherinc?schema=public`

## Environment Setup
1. Updated `.env` file with correct DATABASE_URL
2. Removed conflicting `prisma/.env` file to prevent conflicts

## Database Schema and Seeding
1. Applied Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
2. Seeded the database with initial admin user: `node prisma/seed.cjs`
3. Imported AI tools from Excel file: `node scripts/import-excel-tools.mjs`

## Application Status
The Next.js application is now running correctly with a properly configured PostgreSQL database. The health check endpoint confirms that the database connection is working.

## Next Steps for Full Dockerization
For future complete dockerization, you'll need:
1. A Dockerfile for the Next.js application
2. A docker-compose.yml to orchestrate the application and database services
3. Environment variables configured for container networking

The current setup uses a local PostgreSQL installation, but the same connection configuration will work when moving to a containerized setup by adjusting the host from localhost to the container name.
