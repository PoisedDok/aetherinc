# Admin Login Fix

## Issue
The admin login was failing with invalid credentials and CSRF issues, likely due to the password mismatch between the seeded database and the expected login credentials.

## Solution
Created and executed a script to update the admin user password to match the expected credentials.

### Steps Taken
1. Created `scripts/update-admin-password.mjs` to:
   - Find the admin user by email (`admin@aetherinc.com`)
   - Update the password hash to match the password `admin123`
   - Confirm the update was successful

### Admin Credentials
- **Email**: admin@aetherinc.com
- **Password**: admin123

### Technical Details
- The script uses Prisma Client to connect to the PostgreSQL database
- Password is hashed using bcrypt before storage
- The admin user retains all other properties (role, permissions, etc.)

## Future Considerations
If admin login issues occur again, you can:
1. Re-run the password update script: `node scripts/update-admin-password.mjs`
2. Check the database connectivity
3. Verify the environment variables are set correctly
